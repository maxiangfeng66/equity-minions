TASK 1
i want you to do a thorough analysis based on 

1) industry outlook and size of this industry growth 
2) is this company's business model growing and sustainable? what is this company's own strength and moat and competitive advantage . Business Model is super super important!!!!! Are they really creating value in a sustainable way?
3) corporate governance and company culture. Are they professional or toxic?  Do they value "customer value creation" "do the right things" more than short term profit?
4) calculate stock intrinsic value based on DCF considering below:
a. let's use 8%, 9%, 10%, 11% discount rate as different cases. 
b. let's be very very very deligent on future cash flow (future net income) estimates.

in the next 5 years, what is its growth rate?
in the 5-10 years, what is its growth rate?
10 year onward, what is its growth rate?

for growth companies, a natural assumption is it will have quick growth (even hyper growth) for some time, then growth slows down, then plateaus, then even decline.


start with a base line, then we have super bear, bear, bull, super scenarios. List out clear definitions and clear assumptions under these scenarios, and probabilities. USE GAN and Multi Agent debate system to challenge your assumptions for 10 times (YES, 10 TIMES! 10 TIMES!!!) to have more confident numbers under each scenarios. 

c.your deliverable should be data table of intrinsic value of equity price, based on 2 dimension variables: discount rate and scenarios make your deliverable visualization as clear as possible



TASK 2
After you have done your own analysis, search thoroughly, read creditable market analysis as your reference, study their methodology and assumptions, and list out your key differences



TASK 3

Revisit your analysis, and update your data table and elaborate why you did these changes.


Task 4

Gimme your final simple datatable
