Project Purpose: create multiple agents to do equity research

Idea:

1) go through list.txt, it has the equities i am interested in
2) go through EquityResearch template, research each specific equity (try to use multiple AIs including GPT, Gemini, Grok, Qwen, Deepseek)
3) use multiple agents to challenge each other's assumptions, logics
4) the deliverable should be htmls: one index html with links for each equity; for each individual equity, gimme a decent summary of that company report: eventually i want to know that equity's intrinsic value with scenarios. of course, some equities have narrower uncertainty of its business outlook, some have a lot wider uncertainties of its business outlook. i have to have a probability weighted target price supported by scenario analysis


Rules:
1)try to run as parellel as possible
2) try to interupt me as less as possible
3) try to be as thorogh as possible, take your time
4) try to create multiple agents to have challenges as much as possible
5) if we often run out of the context window, we need to make sure we record what happened before so that the continuing chat does not lose context again
6) try to be as modular as possible, so that we can easily adjust
7) record key thoughts, design in a file called "blueprint.md", it serves as a blueprint of the project. So it keeps the latest design and key info. It should NOT be used as a log. Create log.md to record updates etc.
8) private references: E:\其他计算机\My Computer\平衡表\平衡表\Equities, there are market researches in this folder, search for relevant folders and files.
