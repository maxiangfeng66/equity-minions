**Scenario Probabilities:**
- Super Bear: 5%
- Bear: 20%
- Base: 50%
- Bull: 20%
- Super Bull: 5%

### Value per Share (HKD) by Scenario and Discount Rate:

| Scenario | Probability | 8% | 9% | 10% | 11% |
|----------|-------------|-----|-----|------|------|
| Super Bear | 5% | 0.89 | 0.27 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| Bear | 20% | 3.38 | 1.96 | 0.97 | 0.22 |
| Base | 50% | 6.11 | 3.79 | 2.25 | 1.14 |
| Bull | 20% | 9.95 | 6.69 | 4.47 | 2.88 |
| Super Bull | 5% | 18.31 | 12.60 | 8.79 | 6.19 |

### Probability-Weighted Target Price (HKD):

| Discount Rate | Weighted Value (HKD) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **8%** | **6.08** |
| **9%** | **3.93** |
| **10%** | **2.46** |
| **11%** | **1.42** |

**Calculation (at 9% discount rate):**
= (5% x 0.27) + (20% x 1.96) + (50% x 3.79) + (20% x 6.69) + (5% x 12.60)
= 0.01 + 0.39 + 1.90 + 1.34 + 0.63
= **HKD 3.93**

---

### 5.2 Investment Recommendation

**Central Case Target Price: HKD 3.93** (at 9% WACC)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

| WACC | Target Price (HKD) | Upside/Downside* |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| 8% | 6.08 | +143% |
| 9% | 3.93 | +57% |
| 10% | 2.46 | -2% |
| 11% | 1.42 | -43% |

*Assuming current price of HKD 2.50 (estimated)

---

### 5.3 Appropriate Discount Rate Discussion

**WACC Components:**
- Risk-free Rate: 2.5-3.0% (China 10-year government bond)
- Equity Risk Premium: 6-7% (emerging market)
- Beta: 0.8-1.0 (utility characteristics)
- Cost of Debt: 4-5% (SOE advantage)
- Debt/Equity: 60/40

**Recommended WACC: 9-10%**

Given:
- Stable cash flows (utility characteristics) suggest lower beta
- State ownership reduces financing risk
- Nuclear regulatory risk adds premium
- H-share listing adds liquidity/governance risk
