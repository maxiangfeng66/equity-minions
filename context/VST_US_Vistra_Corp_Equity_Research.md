## 1. INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

### 1.1 US Power Market Overview

The US power market comprises approximately 1,200 GW of generation capacity serving 4,100 TWh of annual demand. Key structural trends include:

- **Data Center Demand Growth**: Projected 15% CAGR from 20 GW to 50 GW by 2030
- **Grid Reliability Focus**: Increasing recognition of dispatchable generation value
- **Energy Transition**: Creating both opportunities and challenges for incumbent generators
- **Electrification**: EVs and heat pumps driving long-term demand growth

### 1.2 Texas ERCOT Market

ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) operates as an energy-only wholesale market covering ~90% of Texas electricity load with unique characteristics:

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Total Capacity | ~140 GW |
| Peak Demand | ~85 GW |
| Price Cap | $5,000/MWh |
| Reserve Margin | 10-15% (below optimal) |
| Market Structure | Energy-only, no capacity payments |

**Key ERCOT Dynamics:**

- **No Capacity Market**: Generators only earn money when running, creating scarcity pricing opportunities
- **High Renewable Penetration**: 50+ GW of wind/solar creates volatility benefiting dispatchable generation
- **Tight Reserve Margins**: Structural scarcity value for reliable generators
- **Rapid Load Growth**: Population growth (~1,000 new residents daily) and industrial expansion

**Post-Winter Storm Uri Reforms:**
- Price cap reduced from $9,000 to $5,000/MWh
- Performance Credit Mechanism (PCM) under development
- Weatherization requirements implemented
- Energy-only structure largely maintained
