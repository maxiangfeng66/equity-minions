    "overview": "Xinte Energy (1799.HK) is one of China's leading polysilicon manufacturers and an integrated renewable energy company with operations spanning polysilicon production, wind power generation, and solar project development. The company is a subsidiary of TBEA Co., Ltd., one of China's largest power transmission equipment manufacturers.",
    "investment_thesis": "Xinte Energy operates in a challenging polysilicon market environment characterized by severe oversupply and price collapse. Despite having cost advantages from its integrated electricity supply and Xinjiang operations, the company faces significant headwinds from industry-wide margin compression. The wind power segment provides diversification but cannot offset polysilicon weakness.",
    "key_highlights": [
      "One of China's top 5 polysilicon producers with approximately 200,000 MT annual capacity",
      "Cost leader benefiting from captive power generation and low-cost Xinjiang location",

The stock trades at a significant discount to our probability-weighted intrinsic value, reflecting the market's pessimism about the polysilicon industry. However, we rate the stock HOLD rather than BUY due to: (1) high uncertainty around the timing of industry recovery, (2) potential for further near-term downside, and (3) risk of capital needs or equity dilution. We would become more constructive on signs of meaningful capacity rationalization or a stabilization in polysilicon prices."
