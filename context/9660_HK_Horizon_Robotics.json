  "executive_summary": {
    "overview": "Horizon Robotics is a leading Chinese provider of computing solutions for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. Founded in 2015 by Dr. Kai Yu, former head of Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning, the company designs AI processors (Journey series) and provides full-stack software solutions for intelligent vehicles. Listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in October 2024, Horizon Robotics has become one of China's most prominent domestic alternatives to foreign autonomous driving chip suppliers.",
    "investment_thesis": "Horizon Robotics occupies a strategic position in China's autonomous driving ecosystem, benefiting from: (1) government push for semiconductor self-sufficiency amid US-China tech decoupling, (2) rapid adoption of ADAS in Chinese NEVs, (3) deep partnerships with major OEMs including Li Auto, BYD, and Volkswagen, and (4) competitive technology with the Journey 5/6 series chips. However, the company remains loss-making with significant R&D burn, faces intense competition from Nvidia and domestic players, and operates in a capital-intensive industry with long product development cycles.",
