  "executive_summary": {
    "overview": "Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG US) is the largest producer of carbon-free energy in the United States, operating the nation's largest nuclear fleet with approximately 21 GW of generating capacity across 14 nuclear power plants (23 reactors). The company spun off from Exelon in February 2022 and has emerged as a pure-play clean energy generator uniquely positioned to benefit from surging data center power demand, AI infrastructure buildout, and the broader clean energy transition.",
    "investment_thesis": "CEG represents a compelling investment opportunity at the intersection of three powerful secular trends: (1) unprecedented data center/AI power demand growth, (2) the nuclear renaissance driven by recognition of nuclear's role in decarbonization, and (3) tightening power markets with rising electricity prices. The landmark 20-year Microsoft PPA for the Three Mile Island restart demonstrates the premium value tech companies place on 24/7 carbon-free power.",
