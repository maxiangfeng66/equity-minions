    "overview": "APT Satellite Holdings Limited is one of Asia's leading commercial satellite operators, providing satellite transponder capacity and related services across the Asia-Pacific region. Listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 1996, the company operates the APSTAR satellite fleet serving broadcasting, telecommunications, and enterprise customers.",
    "investment_thesis": "APT Satellite represents a stable but mature satellite communications business facing structural headwinds from LEO constellation competition. The company benefits from established customer relationships and strategic China market positioning, but growth prospects are constrained by industry disruption. The stock offers dividend yield appeal for income investors but limited capital appreciation potential.",
    "key_highlights": [
      "Operates 5 in-orbit satellites (APSTAR-5C, APSTAR-6, APSTAR-6C, APSTAR-6D, APSTAR-7) providing coverage across Asia-Pacific",
      "Strategic partnership with China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) as major shareholder",
      "Stable revenue from long-term transponder lease agreements with broadcasters and telecom operators",
