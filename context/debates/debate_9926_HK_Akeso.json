This is the first therapy ever to demonstrate superiority over anti-PD-1 in this setting. EGFR+ NSCLC represents approximately 15-20% of lung cancer patients globally, and current options post-TKI failure are limited. With peak global sales potential of $5-10 billion, ivonescimab could be the most valuable asset to emerge from Chinese biotech. The Summit deal at $5 billion total value validates this view - it was the largest ex-China licensing deal for a China-originated biologic at announcement.",

First, this was a China-only trial - US FDA will likely require confirmatory data in Western populations. Second, the comparator arm underperformed versus historical pembrolizumab data in similar settings, raising questions about trial conduct. Third, the path to US approval is complex - Summit is a small company with limited oncology experience, and US regulatory requirements for bispecifics can be unpredictable. The 60% probability assigned to ex-China success may be optimistic. Additionally, the competitive landscape is evolving rapidly with multiple PD-1/VEGF combinations in development globally.",

          "argument": "The $5-10 billion peak sales estimate for ivonescimab requires multiple assumptions to align perfectly. We need to decompose this: EGFR+ NSCLC is a subset of the NSCLC market, pricing in China will face NRDL pressure, and royalty economics in ex-China limit Akeso's capture. If we assume $3-4bn ex-China peak sales and tiered royalties averaging 15%, Akeso's ex-China take is $450-600mn annually. Adding China sales of CNY 12-15bn ($1.7-2.1bn) at 85% gross margin gives operating contribution of $1.4-1.8bn at peak. This is excellent but not transformative enough to justify some of the bull case valuations exceeding HKD 100.

The disagreement centers on: (1) translatability of China data to US regulatory success, (2) ultimate label breadth, and (3) competitive dynamics. A balanced view assigns high probability (85%) to China success given strong local data and regulatory pathway, but more modest probability (50-60%) to US success given execution complexity. The valuation should explicitly separate China-centric scenarios from global success scenarios. At current prices around HKD 52, the China-only value case provides reasonable downside support around HKD 48-50, while global success offers HKD 85-115 upside."

There are now 10+ approved PD-1/PD-L1 agents in China, including global leaders (Keytruda, Opdivo) and aggressive domestic players (Hengrui, Junshi, BeiGene, Innovent). NRDL price cuts have been severe - some PD-1s have seen 70%+ price reductions. While cadonilimab's bispecific differentiation provides some pricing power, it's not immune to pressure.

Clinical data suggests comparable or superior efficacy to ipilimumab + nivolumab combination with better tolerability - this should support premium. However, China's healthcare system increasingly prioritizes cost-effectiveness. The real test will be HCC data - if cadonilimab matches or beats atezolizumab + bevacizumab (Imbrave150 regimen), it could secure a large, differentiated market. But if data is merely competitive, pricing power erodes.

Disagreement centers on ultimate peak sales (CNY 5-10bn range) and margin sustainability. The consensus view settles on CNY 6-7bn peak sales with gradual margin compression to 75-78% as NRDL coverage expands. This implies peak operating contribution of CNY 2.5-3.5bn. Importantly, cadonilimab success is largely already reflected in the current stock price - it's the foundation, not the upside driver.

Sales and marketing costs will rise significantly with ivonescimab launch. The 2025 profitability guidance is achievable only if R&D is constrained, which would sacrifice long-term pipeline value.

However, this requires restraint on R&D that could impact longer-term pipeline. The real question is: should we want Akeso to be profitable in 2025, or should we prefer continued investment?

The key insight from the Critic is important: profitability timing is partially management choice between near-term profits and pipeline investment. The Summit deal economics provide meaningful cushion - milestone payments could contribute $200-400mn over the next 2-3 years. Base case assumption: Akeso achieves modest profitability (CNY 500-800mn net income) in 2025, expanding to CNY 2bn+ by 2027 as operating leverage materializes.
