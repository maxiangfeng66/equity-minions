  "executive_summary": {
    "overview": "GCL Technology Holdings (3800.HK) is one of the world's largest polysilicon manufacturers and a pioneer in granular silicon technology. The company has transitioned from traditional Siemens-process polysilicon to fluidized bed reactor (FBR) granular silicon, achieving significant cost advantages. However, severe industry oversupply has pressured margins and profitability since 2023.",
    "investment_thesis": "GCL Tech represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity in the solar supply chain. Its proprietary granular silicon technology offers 20-30% lower production costs versus traditional methods, positioning it favorably for the industry shakeout. However, near-term headwinds from oversupply, falling polysilicon prices, and capital intensity warrant caution.",
    "key_highlights": [
      "Global leader in granular silicon with 420,000+ MT annual capacity by end-2024",
      "Cost leadership at ~RMB 35-40/kg versus industry average of RMB 50-60/kg",
      "Severe margin compression due to polysilicon price collapse from RMB 300/kg (2022) to RMB 35-45/kg (2024)",
      "Strong balance sheet with strategic government support",
      "Industry consolidation likely to benefit lowest-cost producers"
