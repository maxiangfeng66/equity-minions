    "overview": "GCL Technology Holdings (3800.HK) is the world's largest granular polysilicon producer and a pioneer in FBR (Fluidized Bed Reactor) technology. The company has achieved structural cost advantages through its proprietary granular silicon process, consuming 70% less energy than traditional Siemens methods. Despite severe industry oversupply that has compressed margins since 2023, GCL's cost leadership positions it as a primary survivor and beneficiary of inevitable industry consolidation.",
    "investment_thesis": "GCL Tech represents a high-risk, high-reward turnaround opportunity. The company's 30-40% cost advantage through proprietary technology creates a durable moat in a commoditized market. Near-term pain from oversupply is offset by long-term positioning as the lowest-cost producer. Accumulate on weakness below HKD 0.90 for patient investors with 18-36 month horizons.",
