    "overview": "Legend Biotech is a global biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing novel cell therapies for oncology and other indications. The company's lead product, CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), is a BCMA-directed CAR-T cell therapy approved for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. CARVYKTI is commercialized through a global partnership with Johnson & Johnson (Janssen), representing one of the most significant CAR-T collaborations in the industry.",
    "investment_thesis": "Legend Biotech represents a high-conviction opportunity in the CAR-T cell therapy market with best-in-class clinical data for CARVYKTI. The April 2024 earlier-line FDA approval significantly expands the addressable market. Strong J&J partnership provides commercial infrastructure and risk-sharing. Probability-weighted DCF analysis suggests meaningful upside from current levels, though competitive threats from bispecific antibodies and execution risks warrant attention.",
    "key_highlights": [
      "CARVYKTI achieved blockbuster trajectory with 2024 sales exceeding $1.5 billion (company share ~50%)",
      "FDA approval in April 2024 for earlier-line multiple myeloma (1-3 prior therapies) significantly expanded addressable market",
      "Best-in-class efficacy: 98% ORR, 83% sCR, 34.9 month median PFS in CARTITUDE-1",
      "Strong partnership with J&J provides commercial infrastructure and risk sharing",
      "Robust pipeline including next-gen CAR-T candidates and solid tumor programs",

The $6B peak for Legend's share ($3B) is conservative given potential.",
        "bear_argument": "Peak sales will be capped at $4-4.5B due to: (1) bispecific antibodies capturing 35-40% of market with off-the-shelf convenience, (2) pricing pressure as market matures, (3) next-gen CAR-Ts eroding share, (4) inherent manufacturing scalability limits of autologous therapy.",
        "critic_challenge": "Bull: What specific evidence supports 3-4x market expansion? Earlier-line patients have more treatment options and may prefer less intensive bispecifics first. Bear: If bispecifics are truly competitive, why has CARVYKTI maintained commercial momentum despite Tecvayli availability since 2022?",
        "resolution": "Peak sales likely $5.5-7B range (Legend share $2.75-3.5B). Earlier-line approval does expand market significantly, but bispecifics will serve CAR-T ineligible patients (~30%). Adjust base case peak from $6B to $5.5-6.5B range."

        "bull_argument": "Bispecifics (Tecvayli, Talvey, Elrexfio) serve a different patient population - primarily CAR-T ineligible patients due to age, comorbidities, or logistics. Head-to-head data when available will show CAR-T's superiority in depth and durability of response. CAR-T is curative-intent; bispecifics are chronic therapy.",
        "bear_argument": "Bispecifics are more convenient (no manufacturing delay, no leukapheresis), cheaper (~$150-200K vs $465K), and showing improving durability data. Many physicians and patients will choose convenience over marginally better efficacy. J&J commercializes both CARVYKTI and Tecvayli - conflicting incentives.",
        "critic_challenge": "Bull: Curative-intent is aspirational marketing, not proven. Most patients still relapse after CAR-T. Bear: Cost argument ignores continuous bispecific dosing vs one-time CAR-T. Total cost of care may favor CAR-T for responding patients.",

        "bear_argument": "Frontline MM is different from relapsed setting. Patients have many effective options (VRd, daratumumab combinations). Trial must show dramatic improvement to change practice. CAR-T toxicity may be less acceptable in treatment-naive patients. Probability: 45%.",
        "critic_challenge": "Bull: CARTITUDE-4 was in lenalidomide-refractory patients - not truly frontline. Extrapolation is risky. Bear: Why would CAR-T not work better in fitter, less pretreated patients? The biology should favor earlier intervention.",
        "resolution": "CARTITUDE-5 probability of success: 55-65%. Reduce bull case assumption from 70% to 60%. Frontline success would add $2-3B to peak sales potential but is not in base case."

        "bull_argument": "Delayed neurotoxicity (~5-7%) is manageable and does not fundamentally change risk-benefit. It emerges primarily in heavily pretreated patients. With earlier intervention and better monitoring, incidence may be lower. Most cases are manageable with early intervention.",
        "bear_argument": "This signal is unique to CARVYKTI (not seen with Abecma). As CARVYKTI moves to earlier lines with longer expected survival, patients may be unwilling to accept Parkinson-like symptoms. This could become a significant commercial headwind.",

        "bear_argument": "Autologous CAR-T manufacturing is inherently limited by patient-specific production. CDMOs (Lonza, WuXi) are building CAR-T capacity that will benefit competitors. Allogeneic CAR-T, if successful, would eliminate Legend's manufacturing moat entirely.",
        "critic_challenge": "Bull: What prevents competitors from making similar investments? Bear: Allogeneic has failed to show durability in multiple trials. Why cite it as near-term threat?",
        "resolution": "Manufacturing is currently adequate and improving, but is medium-durability moat (2-4 years). Allogeneic threat is 5+ years away if at all. Maintain base case manufacturing assumptions."

        "bear_argument": "The 50/50 profit split means Legend captures only half the upside. J&J also commercializes Tecvayli and Talvey (bispecifics) which compete for the same patients. J&J may prioritize lower-investment bispecifics over high-investment CAR-T.",
        "critic_challenge": "Bull: If J&J is so aligned, why are they aggressively pushing Tecvayli in the same indication? Bear: Has there been any evidence of J&J deprioritizing CARVYKTI investment?",
