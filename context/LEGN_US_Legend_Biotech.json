    "overview": "Legend Biotech is a global biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing novel cell therapies for oncology and other indications. The company's lead product, CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), is a BCMA-directed CAR-T cell therapy approved for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. CARVYKTI is commercialized through a global partnership with Johnson & Johnson (Janssen), representing one of the most significant CAR-T collaborations in the industry.",
    "investment_thesis": "Legend Biotech represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity in the rapidly growing CAR-T cell therapy market. The company benefits from a validated commercial product (CARVYKTI), a strong partnership with J&J, and a diversified pipeline. However, execution risk, manufacturing complexity, and competitive pressures remain key concerns. The stock offers significant upside if CARVYKTI achieves broader label expansion and the pipeline delivers additional approved therapies.",
    "key_highlights": [
      "CARVYKTI achieved blockbuster trajectory with 2024 sales exceeding $1.5 billion (company share ~50%)",
      "FDA approval in April 2024 for earlier-line multiple myeloma (1-3 prior therapies) significantly expanded addressable market",
      "Strong partnership with J&J provides commercial infrastructure and risk sharing",
      "Robust pipeline including next-gen CAR-T candidates and solid tumor programs",
      "Significant manufacturing scale-up investments to address capacity constraints",
